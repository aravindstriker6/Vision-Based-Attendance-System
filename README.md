# Vision-Based-Attendance-System
In this project we are going to create a vision based attendance system which would detect and recognize the people present. Using CV-based Attendance System will reduce the cost of traditional biometric systems, punching machines, and procurement and maintenance of smart card. The purpose of this research is to develop a fast and accurate intelligent people counting technique for attendance monitoring systems in offices and lecture rooms. It will reduce any option of duplicity for attendance monitoring as the Person's individual face marks his/her attendance. The system is simpler compared to age-old methods and saves time and effort in logging attendance thereby increasing productivity.

In this project , I have attached the requirements.txt , where all required libraries should be downloaded to the code. The main python file is the app.py , before running the code all modules has to be installed in a new environment and we also have other python files which is being used in the app.py. So after all steps are done code will run successfully. We have also attached the demo of our project below.
